This file defines the procedure for specifying help menus, and associating commands with CHAS:

Information regarding help information, command associating, and plugin metadata will be stored in the plugin.

Plugins don't necessarily use commands, as CHAS needs to be be natural.
This means that plugins are free to parse and interpret input in any way they see fit.

However, it is necessary to include a system for defining usage and common commands used within plugins.

All fields will be defined by the plugin.

Metadata:

Plugin metadata will be stored in the '__meta' parameter, and will be in dictionary format.

Format:

{'author': [AUTHOR NAME],
'name': Plugin name}

And others which will be defined later.m

Help:

Defines commands and displays help menu information on said command:

[{[COMMAND NAME]: {'description': '', usage: ''}]

CHAS also supports grouping, and will indent content based on grouping, like so:

[{"Group 1": [{'command 1': 'This is a command']}]
