--== CHAS Options formatting convention: ==--

All options must follow the following format:

{'name': [NAME HERE],
'desc': [DESCRIPTION],
'type': [TYPE OF OPTION],
'value': [VALUE OF THE OPTION]}

Option Types:


1. Simple Selection: Simply select an option from the menu and exit
2. Boolean Selection: Toggle an On/Off value for the option
3. Value Selection: Select an option from a list of values
4. Manual Selection: Manually enter a value for the option(Will automatically converted to a string)
5. Null Selection: Do nothing when selected, great for menu placeholders
6. Sub-menu selection

Users will be prompted with a list of options, or the 'parent list'.
Users can select options from this parent list, and OptionWindow will react diffrently depending on the options selected.

If [1] is selected:

CHAS will close the option window, and return that option selected as a string.

If [2] is selected:

CHAS will toggel this option to the opposite, and continue selecttion.

If [3] is selected:

CHAS will display another window with the necessary options to select. These will follow the same rules, and SHOULD be simple selection only.

If [4] is selected:

CHAS will display an input box for the user to enter input to. This will save any input as a string, so it is up to the application invocking 
the option window to convert it to a format that it requires.

If [5] is selected:

Nothing happens and selection continues. This is meant to be a placeholder.

if [6] is selected:

A sub-menu will be opened using the values in the 'value' filed.

Notice how option 1 is the only option type that exits. The user can exit by pressing 'e' or 'q', and can select the 'exit' button, which is present in all menus.

Return Types:

If the menu is a simple selection, then CHAS will return the name of the option selected.
If we are working with advanced options, then CHAS will return a dictonary mapping the option to selection.

If we are working with sub-menus, then CHAS will return the subvalue as a dictonary in the parent list.

Controls and Keympas:

Users can use the arrow keys to select options, and the keyboard to enter values in input boxes.
Users MUST use enter to select an option.
Users may select 'exit' at the bottom of every menu, or press 'q' or 'e' to exit.

Display:

CHAS will render the description of the highlighted option at the bottom of the window.
CHAS will render the title of the menu at the top left of the screen. If a sub menu is used, then CHAS will make the title of that window the name of the sub menu option.

Option parsing:

CHAS will map the following value to options(is adding with add_options):

If value is a list:

CHAS will create a list of those values, marking them all as Simple Selection.
The names of these options MUST be strings. CHAS will attempt to convert intigers to strings if necessary.
The value does not matter, it will be ignored.

For example, CHAS will create a Simple Selection list out of the following values:

['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3']

[1]: Option 1
[2]: Option 3
[3]: Option 4

If the value is a list:

CHAS will create a list out of the values provided.
CHAS will create the following options out of the following values:

String - Manual Selection
List - Value Select
Boolean - Toggle Select
Dictonary - Sub menu
None - Null Selection
